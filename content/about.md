## About me

Welcome to the Halcyon blog. My real name is Ivan and I'm your host for the day.
Relax and take a look around.

This blog has started after one of my coworkers jokingly complained that I write
too much. So I thought that I should write more, and not necessarily just for
The Man.

I've been interested in tech for as long as I've been able to hold a mouse so I
never know what to tell someone when they ask me for my experience. I was there
for dial-up, both browser wars, and had a YouTube account before it was
bought by Google - but all of those things can't really go on a resume. Perhaps
I should just say that I've been charging money to make websites since 2015.
I've worked on small startup projects as well as multi-million user enterprise
behemoths, so I've seen a lot of things.

If you would like to hit me up - to send me kind words, validate my writing, ask
me to clarify something or maybe even interject for a moment, I'm available via
mail on (hello&laquo;at&raquo;halcyon.hr), or via social links on the blog's
front page.

I am also available for consultations and light freelance work, if you need an
outsider's opinion on your code, or general advice.

## About this site

I've tried to keep it lightweight and fast. Hugo is used to generate static
pages, and I incorporated modern, native options wherever I could (for example,
dark mode based on OS settings and native share sheets wherever available).

One of the goal was also to keep the website as accessible as possible. Please
reach out with suggestions if you're having trouble accessing the content and
I'll do everything I can to make it right.
