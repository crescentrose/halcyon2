# the halcyon blog

This repository hosts content and themes for the [Halcyon
blog](https://halcyon.hr). It's built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io).

To run the site after installing Hugo, just clone the repository and run `hugo
server`.

## Theme

The theme (`halcyon2`) is a simple, minimalist theme custom-built for the
website. Its goal is to provide a fast, legible experience on all modern
devices, respecting the user's settings and falling back to native
implementations of functionality whenever possible. Backwards compatibility with
ancient browsers is not a concern, though the website should still be readable
and functional on those browsers and nothing should be broken on purpose.
